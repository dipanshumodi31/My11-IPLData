# üèè My11-IPLData

**My11-IPLData** is a data analysis project focused on the IPL 2024 season. It uses Bright Data's web scraper to collect player data from **[ESPNcricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/)**, which is then processed using **Python** and visualized in **Power BI**.
The project features interactive dashboards that break down player performances across different roles (e.g., fast bowlers, power hitters, all-rounders) with key metrics like strike rate, economy rate, and batting average. A unique **Top 11 Players Selection Page** allows users to build their ideal team based on performance data.
This project automates the process of evaluating IPL players, providing valuable insights for team selectors and analysts.

## üéØ Problem Solved

The project aimed to simplify player performance evaluation in the IPL by transforming large volumes of unstructured cricket data into actionable insights. Traditionally, selecting top performers across different player roles (openers, middle-order anchors, finishers, bowlers) required manual analysis of scattered statistics. 

This project automated the data collection, processing, and visualization using Power BI and Python, enabling:

- Objective comparison of players based on multi-dimensional metrics (e.g., strike rate, economy, consistency).
- Role-wise identification of top performers using filtered dashboards.
- A ‚ÄúFinal 11‚Äù recommendation system to suggest the most balanced team composition.
- Visual analysis of trends, performance distributions, and venue/toss impact, supporting more data-driven decisions in team selection and match analysis.

By integrating scraping, ETL, and dynamic visual reporting, the project provided a comprehensive, scalable solution for performance analysis in T20 cricket.

## üîß Data Collection Process

The data for the **My11-IPLData** project is collected from **ESPNcricinfo** using **Bright Data‚Äôs web scraping tools**. The process involves:
1. **Web Scraping with Bright Data**: A scraper is used to extract comprehensive IPL 2024 player data, including match statistics, batting and bowling performance, and player roles.

![BattingSummary](images/web_scrapping_batting_summary.jpg)
![BowlingSummary](images/web_scrapping_bowling_summary.jpg)
![PlayerInfo](images/web_scrapping_player_info.jpg)

2. **Data Points Collected**: Key player metrics such as runs scored, wickets taken, batting average, strike rate, economy rate, and more are gathered for each player across all matches.
3. **JSON to CSV Conversion**: The raw scraped data, initially structured in JSON format, is converted into **CSV/Excel** format for easy handling and analysis.
4. **Data Validation**: The scraped data undergoes validation to check for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring accuracy.
5. **Data Aggregation**: The data is aggregated at both player and match levels, providing a complete view of player performances across the IPL 2024 season.
This process enables the collection of IPL player performance data, providing a solid foundation for analysis and visualization.
